# SARS-CoV-2_BW.1

## Description: 
This code represents the implementation of our methodology for preprocessing the Genomic DB. With this code, we generated the images and results of the manuscript [XX] submitted on Journal of XXXXXX and available at XXXXXXX. 

# Structure of the code (Pseudocode): 
1) Importing dataset
2) Computing seven days moving average
3) Creation of a weekly calender for the plots
 
4) Plotting different interaction-scenarios (relative frequency, heatmap, phylogenetic tree)


## Table of Contents:
This repository contains different types of formats. We have different tsv files which contain the data until 7th November.
- The XXX file: Sweden_data.xlsx contains the data for Sweden until 15th December.
- The XXX file : Austria.xlsx contains the data for Austria until 15th December.
- The XXX file: Lux-trial_15December.xlsx contains the data for Luxembourg until 15th December.
- Script XXX.R: Luxembourg_Residents_Fit_1st_and_2nd_wave_Optimize_and_MCMC_ParallelFullChains.ipynb is the code for Luxembourg.
- Script XXX.R: new_model_for_Sweden_minimize-latest-version.ipynb is the code for Sweden.
- Script XXX.R: Austria_main_model.ipynb is the code for Austria.

## How to run the scripts

To run our code:
- Download the full content of the directory containing this README file.
- Make sure you have installed R (we developed the code under version: R.4.2.2, so we suggest this or subsequent versions). Additionally, the code has been tested on macOS Sierra 10.12.6 and should run on every OS.
- Open Jupyter.
- Select the script corresponding to the analysis you are interested in running, and run it.


We used the following libraries and version of the libraries :
